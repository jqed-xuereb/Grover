# QISKit Grover's
This project includes a formulation of Grover's Algorithm using IBM's QISKit package on Python.
It's my first implimentation of a Quantum Algorithm and should be considered an attempt at an introductory exercise to attain a better understanding.
This project  was inspired by and done during [QuID 2018](qid.ethz.cz) at ETH Zurich and owes a lot to [this](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/reference/algorithms/grover_algorithm.ipynb) pre-existing implentation of Grover's Algorithm in QISKit.
